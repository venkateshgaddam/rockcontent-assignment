I used CQRS Desing pattern of a microservice architecture.
I have installed Swagger in the Code. So when run Locally, we just append it with https:localhost/swagger which will display all the APIs for you.

#NOTE
I have written code for writing into redis and getting from REDIS but was not able to create a REDIS instance because of the time constarint. Please excuse me for this.
